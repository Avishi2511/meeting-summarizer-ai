Good morning, everyone. Let's start with the campaign update. Jenna, you go first?

Sure. The email campaign went out yesterday and we already have a 28 percent open rate, which is a good start. 
We’ll review conversions by Friday.

That’s promising. I’d like to add a follow-up SMS campaign next week. Any objections?

Sounds good. Let’s test it on a smaller group first.

Also, quick update on the influencer side—we’ve locked in 3 collaborations. Deliverables expected by early next week.

Awesome. Final reminder: the Q2 strategy deck is due this Thursday. Don’t forget to upload your slides by end of day tomorrow.

Got it.
